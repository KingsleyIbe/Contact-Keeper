#CONTACT KEEPER

Full stack MERN Contact Manager with React hooks, Context & JWT authentication created by 
following the 'React Front To Back 2019' Udemy course lectured by Brad Traversy. 
The user can register/login to an account which will show information about the contacts 
they have saved. Each user is unique and has their own set of contacts, they can also filter/search their contacts to view specific people. 
The app implements ReactJS Context API, while using MongoDB and ExpressJS for the backend.
